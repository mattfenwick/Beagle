A simple, experimental language for teaching and learning





Goals
-----------------------------

 - bare bones:  minimalist core

 - as little sugar as possible

 - no thought given to computational efficiency

 - as few special cases as possible

 - extensible and composable

 - as much as possible defined in libraries
