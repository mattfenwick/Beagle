Beagle is a dialect of Lisp.  It is based loosely on the lambda calculus.


It has a small number of built-in special forms.  Each of these has its own evaluation rules.


Other than the special forms, Beagle is an applicative order language:  arguments are evaluated
before function application.  Thus, Beagle is strict. 


Additionally, Beagle is lexically scoped and dynamically typed.
