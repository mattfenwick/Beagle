## Implementation Code ##
-----

 - improve js error message:  include all relevant information, such as the arguments that
   caused the problem

 - test primitive data types (and error-check in their constructors)

 - requite whitespace before comment?

 - `tokenization` postcondition:  never consecutive comments or whitespace tokens



## Beagle code ##
--------

 - testing library

 - comparison functions (`>`, `<=`, etc.)

 - `define` should accept a docstring?  require it?

 - number functions/values:  `*, /, **, e, pi, range`



## Repl ##

 - get `Beagle` module rock solid to allow refactoring of REPL

 - style, layout, design

 - interactive docs?
